# newsApp

### Run demo locally
* Install Packages - `yarn`
* Runs the app in the development mode - `react-native run-android`


####  Note: 
* Because of this assignment is small I didn't use any external state management library (Redux, Mobx, ...etc)
* For task 5, I have no idea where should I put a link to this screen so I put an Icon on App Header to navigate US news publishers.
* To save time I didn't write test cases for this assignment.
